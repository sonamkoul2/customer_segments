In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

It was going to be obvious that the perimeter and the area of the land marks were almost 100% correlated to the length and the width of each land marks, because length by width gives the area, also 2 by Length plus width gives the perimeter, therefore, I could remove either the length and width or the perimeter and the area to get less features, but neither of both was going to be directly correlated with the number of murder or security level around the given housing area, because the security level feature cannot be known from length and width, therefore it is relevant like Delicatessen feature is relevant for the customer segement data.   \n",

When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data â€” if any. However, we can quantify the \"goodness\" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*.

Sample points 1 and sample point 2 are both closer to center 1 cluster which could be either Restaurant, Hotel or cafe.
