- The dataset used in this project is included as customers.csv. You can find more information on this dataset on the UCI Machine Learning Repository page.

- ### Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7]
- [NumPy]
- [pandas]
- [scikit-learn (v0.17)]
- [matplotlib]
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook].

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda] distribution of Python.
